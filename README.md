# Cpp-Sentence-hash
Add values of each letters numeric value, mod by 31

a program to generate a hash value of any word or sentence. Enter a “sentence” that may be as small as a single word. Then compute a hash of the “sentence” using the numeric value of each letter (A=a=1 ...  Z=z=26) and mod-31 as the hash function.
